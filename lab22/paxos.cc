// This module implements the proposer and acceptor of the Paxos
// distributed algorithm as described by Lamport's "Paxos Made
// Simple".  To kick off an instance of Paxos, the caller supplies a
// list of nodes, a proposed value, and invokes the proposer.  If the
// majority of the nodes agree on the proposed value after running
// this instance of Paxos, the acceptor invokes the upcall
// paxos_commit to inform higher layers of the agreed value for this
// instance.



// For testing purposes

// Call this from your code between phases prepare and accept of proposer

  if (break1) {
    printf("Dying at breakpoint 1!\n");

// Call this from your code between phases accept and decide of proposer

  if (break2) {
